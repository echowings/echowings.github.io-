But how about router build in virtualization? After tried to do it, I was failed. because virtual switch made networking very slow. So i just use dedicate server as a router.
Recently days, I just learn proxmox and find pci-e pass through function. I think maybe it is way to make routing virtualization.</description></item></channel></rss>
